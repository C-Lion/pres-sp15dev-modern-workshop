Abstract
--------
> So you’re interested in becoming a SharePoint developer but you don’t know where to start? In this workshop I’ll get you up to speed. You might have heard the terms full-trust solutions, sandbox solutions, SharePoint apps, server-side code, client side object model (CSOM), cloud app model (CAM), REST API… what does it all mean? When should you use one over the other? Have no fear! The current release of SharePoint (SharePoint 2013) and Office 365 embrace the client-over-HTTP model of development which makes the lives of developers much easier.

> In this workshop we’ll start out for those new to SharePoint development with some background to get you up to speed quickly. Then we’ll look at landscape of the development world for Office 365, SharePoint & the cloud. It doesn’t matter if your SharePoint environment is on-premises, hybrid or hosted in the cloud with Office 365. When you walk out of this workshop you’ll be armed with the knowledge to create custom solutions to your business problems using the best tools, techniques and libraries at your disposal for modern day development. Further more, during this workshop I will also highlight specific sessions at the rest of the conference where you can dive deeper and learn more about specific topics we touch on during the workshop.
