Modern Office 365, SharePoint & Cloud Development Ramp-Up
=========================================================
> *Follow along at [github.com / andrewconnell / pres-modern-spdev-workshop](http://github.com/andrewconnell/pres-modern-spdev-workshop)*

This workshop consists of four parts which are as follows:



[Part 1: Understanding SharePoint](presentation-part1.md)
---------------------------------------------------------
In this section we will quickly run through some terms and concepts that every SharePoint developer must be familiar with and understand. If you already know a little bit about SharePoint, you might not get much out of this, we need to level set with everyone.



[Part 2: Solution-Based Development](presentation-part2.md)
---------------------------------------------------------
In part 2 of this workshop we are going to dive into the more traditional and, dare we say, *legacy* way of customizing & extending SharePoint. By the end of this section you'll understand what features are and what's involved in building solutions, not to mention the different types of solutions: farm (aka: fully-trusted) or sandboxed (aka: partially trusted) solutions. But most importantly you will have an idea when are the best types of situations where each type of solution fits the scenario.



[Part 3: App Model-Based Development](presentation-part3.md)
---------------------------------------------------------
Next we will move into the newest customization approach available to customers: the SharePoint App Model. This is the newest option and one Microsoft would prefer we all move to. At the conclusion of this section you'll have a good grasp on the different types of apps and when it makes the most sense to create apps.



[Part 4: Client APIs, App Types & App Security](presentation-part4.md)
---------------------------------------------------------
In the last part of this workshop we will look at the different types of development patterns available to developers. These will be a bit SharePoint App Model heavy, but some of the patterns could be applied to solution-based development as well. Finally we will touch on a very important subject, that of app identity and security.



Thanks! Any Questions?
